## Gratitude Note
I am grateful for my AP Calc teacher from last year Mrs. Nydam, as she always pushed me to try my hardest and focus on what was important: the understanding of the answer not just the answer. I am glad that she was my teacher for two trimesters, and without her I feel like would not be prepared for the AP test, as well as the enviornments of all my classes like this one. 

I am grateful for my dad because he has helped me various times even when he did not know how to do them. He always makes sure that I am happy and will always be there regardless. I remember when he stayed up till 2 am with me last year when I had to figure out how to deploy with raspberry pi and he did not have to do that, but he did.
