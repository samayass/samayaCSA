    "## Vocab\n",
    "### Inheritance, extends\n",
    "- Inheritance is a way for attributes and methods to be inherited from one class to another\n",
    "- Extends is what allows you to bring those attributes from one class to another\n",
    "- example: [fibonacci](https://samayass.github.io/samayaCSA/jupyter/2022/09/24/fibonacci.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subclass constructor, super Keyword2\n",
    "- A subclass inherits all the members from the superclass while the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass\n",
    "- Super keyword refers to superclass objects; it is used to call superclass methods and to access the superclass costructor\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overloading a method, same name different parameters\n",
    "- Overloading a method in java is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but with different parameters\n",
    "- Instead of defining two methods that do the same thing, it is better to overload one\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overriding a method, same signature of a method\n",
    "- Method overriding occurs when a subclass has the same method as the parent class\n",
    "- When a subclass provides a particular implementation of a method declared by one of its parent classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract Class, Abstract Method\n",
    "- A abstract class cannot be instantiated but they can be subclassed\n",
    "- An abstract method is a method that has just the method definition but does not contain implementation"

    "## Inheritance\n",
    "- The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing constructors for subclasses\n",
    "- Allows reusing the code adn adding attributes if needed in every subclass.\n",
    "- A subclass can also become a super class by extending it again in another subclass\n",
    "- Same goes for a constructor in which the keyword 'super' is used to call the super class constructor and can add additional attributes for personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overriding methods\n",
    "- @Override - different implementations to the method of superclass\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "- Can be used when we have multiple classes that are related by inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object superclass\n",
    "- located at the top of every class hierarchy\n",
    "- all the other classes in hierarchy can use the attributes and methods of the object  superclass through inheritance."
