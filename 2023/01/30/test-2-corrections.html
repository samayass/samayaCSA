<p>A would be incorrect because this would give the result if the elements around mat[2][2] did not change because of the previous iteration.</p>

<p>C would be incorrect because it would mean that the fourth number in both of the strings were equal and that is not the case.</p>

<p><img src="https://samayass.github.io/samayaCSA/assets/img/2023-01-30-test-2-corrections/media/image3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>B is incorrect because line 8 is supposed to traverse through the two dimensional array (arr), but with B it is not doing that C does because of the int[]</p>

<p><img src="https://samayass.github.io/samayaCSA/assets/img/2023-01-30-test-2-corrections/media/image6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>C is incorrect because by subtracting one we are skipping the last element of the list, but without subtracting one we would get the actual size of the list.</p>

<p><img src="https://samayass.github.io/samayaCSA/assets/img/2023-01-30-test-2-corrections/media/image4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>C is incorrect because it trys to print j which is a row of the array instead of an element j.</p>

<p><img src="https://samayass.github.io/samayaCSA/assets/img/2023-01-30-test-2-corrections/media/image7.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>B is incorrect because this would be the answer if sm was updated when a string shorter than arr[j] was found instead of a new smallest value being found.</p>
