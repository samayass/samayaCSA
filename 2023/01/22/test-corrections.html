<p>B is the wrong answer because the loop is supposed to go through the rows of the 2D Array and each row of the arr is a 1D Array.</p>

<p>C is the wrong answer because this would be the answer if the counter was countring when a is not followed by b and not followed by a space. The code is asking for a not followed by b.</p>

<p>C is incorrect because the code does not work when the last element in all the columns does not have the letter a in it. So the option that would not work would be d.</p>

<p>E is incorrect because the method does not always work. B would be the correct option because the loop should only iterate while j &lt; arr.length.</p>

<p>C is the incorrect answer because the original code outputs the sum of twice the elements in the array, but this code prints twice the sum of the integers from 1 to the array length.</p>

<p><img src="https://samayass.github.io/samayaCSA/assets/img/2023-01-22-test-corrections/media/image4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>E is incorrect because only line 4 will cause the error not both.</p>

<p><img src="https://samayass.github.io/samayaCSA/assets/img/2023-01-22-test-corrections/media/image5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>C is incorrect because the first segment will cause an out of bounds error and both codes do not work.</p>
