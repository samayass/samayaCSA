Hearing about a Cognitive science major made me realize that while Computer science is a competitive major I can still utilize the concepts I learned in these AP classes and apply them to a topic I am interested in. For example, I enjoy tutoring, so I could use my development and teamwork skills I have gained from PBL coding to create a space that helps others learn about topics they are interested in. Also, all of the alumni emphasized the importance of trying to stay motivated when coding and not comparing yourself to others because everyone is on their own path, but will eventually reach the same place when the effort is put in. This resonated with me because at the beginning of CSP I was not motivated to learn concepts and I was only interested in the points, but as I began to actually try to understand the topics the class became more interesting, and I was able to take away more from the assignments we were given.]]></summary></entry></feed>
