<ul>
  <li>We can control a lot more of our happiness than we think</li>
  <li>Materialistic things do not matter as much as we think they do</li>

  <li>Knowing is half the battle so we must put in the work to be able to actually experience that happiness</li>
  <li>We always want moe than what we have but we have to train ourselves to be content</li>
  <li>Helping others will help us become happier as we feel like we are living for someone other than oursleves</li>
  <li>Prioritize social connection does not have to be deep or long it can be with anyone</li>
  <li>Make time for gratitude like make a list of things we are grateful for</li>
  <li>Healthy practices matter we should be getting enough sleep and exercise can help us feel more awake and connected in what we are learning</li>

<p>I am grateful for my AP Calc teacher from last year Mrs. Nydam, as she always pushed me to try my hardest and focus on what was important: the understanding of the answer not just the answer. I am glad that she was my teacher for two trimesters, and without her I feel like would not be prepared for the AP test, as well as the enviornments of all my classes like this one.</p>

<p>I am grateful for my dad because he has helped me various times even when he did not know how to do them. He always makes sure that I am happy and will always be there regardless. I remember when he stayed up till 2 am with me last year when I had to figure out how to deploy with raspberry pi and he did not have to do that, but he did.</p>
